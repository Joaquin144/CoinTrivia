## MVC (Model-View-Controller) App Architecture

The Coin Trivia app follows the industry-standard MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, providing a robust and scalable structure for the application. This architecture promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular and maintainable.

### Model

The Model represents the data and business logic of the app. It includes the data structures, database interactions, API requests, and other components responsible for handling the app's data.

### View

The View layer is responsible for the app's user interface and presentation. It includes all the visual components such as activities, fragments, and layouts that the users interact with. In Coin Trivia, the View layer encompasses the various screens, UI elements, and navigation flows.

### Controller

The Controller acts as the intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles user input, updates the Model, and manipulates the View accordingly. The Controller layer in Coin Trivia encapsulates the logic for user interactions, manages the app's state, and orchestrates the flow of data between the Model and the View.

By adopting the MVC architecture, the Coin Trivia app achieves a clear separation of concerns, allowing for easier code organization, testability, and future scalability. The Model-View-Controller pattern promotes code reusability, enhances development efficiency, and ensures a more maintainable and extensible app codebase.
